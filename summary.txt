For my project, I used Python and Plotly to analyze the 2011 Indian census survey. The census is a comprehensive data collection effort undertaken by the Indian government every ten years to gather demographic and socio-economic information about the country's population.

Using Plotly, I created an interactive map of India that allowed users to select different states and parameters such as literacy rates, education levels, religion, sex ratio, and household characteristics. The dropdown feature allowed users to explore and compare different variables across the different states.

To create the interactive map, I processed and cleaned the census data using Python. I then used Plotly to create the map and integrate the dropdown feature. The interactive map allowed me to explore the data more effectively and gain insights into different trends and patterns. For example, I was able to identify differences in literacy rates and education levels across different states, and variations in the sex ratio and household characteristics.

Overall, my project demonstrated my skills in data analysis, Python programming, and data visualization using Plotly. It showcased my ability to work with complex datasets and draw meaningful insights from the data using interactive visualizations.
